# FactionPaint
## What is FactionPaint?

FactionPaint is a [Torch](https://torchapi.net/) plugin for Space Engineers. It allows players to paint blocks that are owned by their faction members, themselves, or nobody.

## How do you use it?

Once you have [Torch](https://torchapi.net/) set up, just drop the FactionPaint.zip file into your Plugins folder.

## How do I build it?
Install Visual Studio Community Edition (I used VS 2015), open the solution, and build.

Note: You may need to re-include the references, as they utilize hard-coded paths. 

Torch has a wiki page on setting up the references and other plugin development information here: [Torch Plugin Development](https://wiki.torchapi.net/index.php/Plugin_Development_Tutorials#Managing_Dependencies)

## Why is there no config file or customization?
I mostly wrote this for my buddy's server, releasing because I've seen the same question come up before. The code is super simple, so you can customize it as you need.
